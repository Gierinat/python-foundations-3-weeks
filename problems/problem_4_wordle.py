Write a function that takes a word and a guess and produces the following result:
- ğŸ’š if a letter is in the right place
- ğŸ’› if a letter is in the word but in the wrong place
- ğŸ–¤ if the letter is not in the word

If the word is "hello" and the guess is "world", it should return "ğŸ–¤ğŸ’›ğŸ–¤ğŸ’šğŸ–¤".

Get the test suite in test_wordle.py to pass.
