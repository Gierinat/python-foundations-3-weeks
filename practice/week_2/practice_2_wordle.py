Create a complete Wordle clone.
https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

It should:
- Get a random word from a file
- Ask for user input
- Validate that it's a valid word of the right length
- Print the result that shows letters in the right place, wrong place and not in word
- Give the user 6 tries to get the right answer

You can also print out the alphabet with each letter as:
- grey if not guessed
- black if guessed and not in word
- green if guessed and in the right spot
- yellow if guessed and in the wrong spot

You could keep track of the user's guess distribution and streak by storing data in a file or database.
