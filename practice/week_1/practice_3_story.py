Create a choose-your-own-adventure story in the console.

Bonus: Instead of just making Yes/No choices, include things like:
- numbers w/ range conditions
- randomization (like dice rolls)
- battles against the computer (like rock-paper-scissors)

Email your project to me at arianne.dee.studios@gmail.com if you want to show off or need help.
Let me know if you would be okay with me sharing your project in the next class.
